# Book-Splendor
Exam project in NodeJs.
[Link to exam project description.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j1CeNNemhCCEhuVvSgk5E1cxRZFJT5AY8TkRGTp2428/edit#)

The idea of the project is to create a website for book enthusiasts both to keep track of their own reading lists, to explore other reads and potentially have a network of friends - whose brain is also full of amazing stories!

## Set-up

### Server
1. Create .env file in image of .env.sample.
2. Install dependencies from package.json `npm i`
3. Run ddl file to create database `node .\database\ddl.js`
4. Start server `node app.js`

### Client
1. Install dependencies from package.json `npm i`
2. Build client `npm run build`
3. Preview `npm run preview`

Alternatively you might want to work with the project as in development using `nodemon.cmd .\app.js` in server and `npm run dev` in client.
